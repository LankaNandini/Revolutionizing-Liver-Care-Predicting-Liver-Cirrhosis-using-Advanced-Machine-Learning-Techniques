# Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis Using Advanced Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a machine learning-based web application that predicts the presence of **Liver Cirrhosis** using clinical patient data. It uses advanced models such as **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Logistic Regression** to assist healthcare professionals in early detection, improving diagnosis speed and accuracy.

By leveraging clinical features like bilirubin, albumin, INR, and ascites, this application provides real-time predictions and insights into liver health.

## üéØ Objective

To create an accurate, accessible, and scalable AI-powered system that can:
- Predict liver cirrhosis from routine patient data
- Reduce diagnosis delays in rural or under-resourced regions
- Aid doctors with decision support and risk classification

## ‚úÖ Model Performance

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest  | 94.8%    | 93%       | 92%    | 92.4%    |
| XGBoost        | 93.6%    | 91%       | 90%    | 90.5%    |
| Logistic Reg.  | 87.4%    | 85%       | 83%    | 84%      |

## üß† How It Works

1. User enters clinical features into the form or uploads a CSV
2. Server processes the input and runs the ML model
3. Model returns a prediction: **Cirrhosis / No Cirrhosis**
4. Output displayed with probability/confidence score
